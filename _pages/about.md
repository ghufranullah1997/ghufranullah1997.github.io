"**Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸš§ This website is still under construction, so things might be a little bit messy â€” but Iâ€™m working on it! Check back soon for more updates!**"

My name is Ghufran Ullah.

I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Information and Communication Technology (Data Analytics) at the University of Turku, Finland. I hold a previous Masterâ€™s in Computer Science and Applications, with research focused on Islamophobic tweet detection using transfer learning. My academic background is built on practical and research-oriented experiences in deep learning, sentiment analysis, and computer vision.

I have previously worked as a Junior Research and Development Engineer at Vedic Info Systems, where I developed real-time deep learning models for analyzing echocardiographic and angiographic data. I also completed internships in data science and business analysis, contributing to student performance prediction models and dashboard insights.

Some of my notable research projects include suicidal tweet classification, masked face detection, and agricultural product quality assessment, several of which were presented at IEEE conferences.

Publications can be found on my [publications page](/al-folio/publications/), rendered using Jekyll from the `papers.bib` file.
